## 🚀 How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd client && npm start
```

### Step 2: Create Admin User
Since the first user becomes admin automatically:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Create your first account (this will be admin)
3. Login with those credentials

### Step 3: Access Admin Dashboard
1. After login, you'll see "Admin Dashboard" button in header
2. Click it to go to http://localhost:3000/admin
3. View the beautiful dashboard with:
   - User statistics cards
   - Users table
   - Admin controls

## 🔧 Database Setup (Optional)

If you want to set up MongoDB locally:

### Option 1: Install MongoDB
```bash
# macOS with Homebrew
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community
```

### Option 2: Use MongoDB Atlas (Cloud)
1. Go to https://www.mongodb.com/atlas
2. Create free account
3. Get connection string
4. Update `server/.env` with your connection string
